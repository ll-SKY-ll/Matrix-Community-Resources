            <h2>What are moderation bots?</h2>
            <p>Moderationbots in Matrix are mainly used to easily ban users from rooms, delete spam messages and handle server ACLs in rooms.<br> <br> The single most effective feature that all of them share however, is the ability to subscribe to so called "policy lists" where they can synchronize user and server bans. <br> The best example of such a list is the <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#community-moderation-effort-bl:neko.dev" style="color: #0DBD8B;"> CME</a> (community moderation effort) list. This list is maintained by a set of highly trusted community members and used by many in the matrix community to keep their rooms free of spam.<br> <br> </p>
            
            <h2>Why should I use one?</h2>
            <p style="font-weight: 800;">Automate banning spammers and removing spam</p>
            <p class="indent">Bots also work while you sleep. Regular spammers that join many rooms to spam, will often land on shared policy lists pretty quickly. That way, most of the bad content will be automatically handled by your moderation bot.</p>

            <h2 style="text-align: center; border-bottom: 2px solid #0DBD8B; padding-bottom: 2px" >Which bots exist?</h2>
            <p>Basic features that they all share:</p>
            <p class="indent"> ✅ Automatically ban users in rooms based on policy lists</p>
            <p class="indent"> ✅ Automatically set server ACLs in rooms based on policy lists</p>
            <p class="indent"> ✅ Automatically redact messages based on preconfigured ban reasons</p>

            <h2>Draupnir</h2>
            <p style="font-weight: 800;" >Github repo: <a href="https://github.com/the-draupnir-project/Draupnir" style="color: #0DBD8B;"> Draupnir</a><br> Support room on matrix: <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#draupnir:matrix.org" style="color: #0DBD8B;">#draupnir:matrix.org</a></p>
            <p class="indent"> Draupnir is a fork of mjolnir, with faster paced and more community driven development, often deployed to non-foundation communities. Its more performant than Mjolnir and has more features. It has also seen a lot of work in terms of making it more user error safe than Mjolnir, meaning that its harder to accidentally do something wrong.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>Meowlnir</h2>
            <p style="font-weight: 800;" >Github repo: <a href="https://github.com/maunium/meowlnir" style="color: #0DBD8B;"> Meowlnir</a> <br> Support room on matrix: <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#meowlnir:maunium.net" style="color: #0DBD8B;">#meowlnir:maunium.net</a></p>
            <p class="indent"> Meowlnir is the youngest and probably fastest one of them. It works best with synapse and can even send redactions for softfailed events.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>Mjolnir</h2>
            <p style="font-weight: 800;" >Github repo: <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/mjolnir" style="color: #0DBD8B;"> Mjolnir</a> <br> Support room on matrix: <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#mjolnir:matrix.org" style="color: #0DBD8B;">#mjolnir:matrix.org</a></p>
            <p class="indent"> Mjolnir is the oldest one of the bots, used for all the rooms under matrix.org control. Similar to Draupnir but slower and with less features. </p>

            <h2 style="text-align: center; border-bottom: 2px solid #0DBD8B; padding-bottom: 2px" >Policy lists</h2>
            <h2>What are Policy lists?</h2>
            <p class="indent">Policy lists are special matrix rooms that contain "m.policy.rule.user" events, these events can be read by moderation bots. Policy lists are like a shared blacklist and bots can subscribe to them. <br> For example: If a user starts spamming in a room and gets added to a policy list that your bot subscribes to, your bot will block that user from your rooms too. </p>
            <br>
            <h2>What lists exist?</h2>
            <p style="font-weight: 800;" >Community Moderation Effort [CME]:</p>
            <p class="indent"> This list is maintained by the matrix community itself and contains spammer & scammer.<br> It is trusted by many, including the Debian and the Ubuntu community. This list is generally really fast and has a extremely low rate of false positives. False positives also get removed as soon as people are made aware of it. <br> <br> The policy room is: <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#community-moderation-effort-bl:neko.dev" style="color: #0DBD8B;"> #community-moderation-effort-bl:neko.dev</a> </p>   
            <br>
            <p style="font-weight: 800;" >Matrix.org code of conduct [COC]:</p>
            <p class="indent"> This list is maintained by the matrix.org foundation.<br> It is used by the foundation itself and some communities use it too. This list contains bans for all kinds of behaviour that violdated the <a href="https://matrix.org/legal/code-of-conduct/" style="color: #0DBD8B;"> matrix.org code of conduct</a>. This means that this list does not only contain spammers but also trolls, rude people and more.<br> <br> The policy room is: <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#matrix-org-coc-bl:matrix.org" style="color: #0DBD8B;"> #matrix-org-coc-bl:matrix.org</a> </p>   
            <br>
            <p style="font-weight: 800;" >More lists?</p>
            <p class="indent"> There is a matrix space with a big collection of ban lists, they usually have descriptions for the scope they aim to cover. <br> <br> The space is at: <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#jjj-banlist-collection:matrix.org" style="color: #0DBD8B;"> #jjj-banlist-collection:matrix.org</a> </p>

            <h2 style="text-align: center; border-bottom: 2px solid #0DBD8B; padding-bottom: 2px" >Where can I get one</h2>
            <p>Moderationbots require setup and maintenance, they also generally need accounts without ratelimits to effectively delete spam and most importantly, they need to run somewhere. This will be out of reach for most users.
            <br>    
            This page will show some of the alternative options.</p>
            <h2>Ask your homeserver admin</h2>
            <p class="indent">You can ask your homeserver admin if they are open to the idea of offering you a moderation bot.<br> <br> Some servers like tchncs.de offer their users to invite their moderation-bot to their rooms and give it moderator permissions.<br>This will allow for basic functionality like automatically banning users who get added to banlists and also automatically deleting spam from them. This will however not give you the full functionality of the bot since you wont have access to the management room.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>Draupnir4All</h2>
            <p style="font-weight: 800;" >A service that offers Draupnir moderationbots for communities and moderators</p>
            <p class="indent">This is a service, provided by MTRNord to offer draupnir instances with access to all its features for everyone. <br> For more information visit the projects <a href="https://docs.draupnir.midnightthoughts.space/" style="color: #0DBD8B;">website</a>.</p>
